Ludum Dare 41: Arcade Typing Shooter
====================================

This is my first Ludum Dare project. I didn't have the full weekend to work on it, only Friday night and Sunday. I'm happy with the results though. It's very simple, but was a blast to make.

This was a **COMPO** Project. I worked alone. I created all of the code, art, and music during the time period.
